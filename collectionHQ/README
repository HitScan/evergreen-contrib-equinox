The scripts in this directory are used to produce
a periodic report in text format of bibs, holdings and 
holds in an Evergreen database for submission to collectionHQ.

Installation and usage:

[1] Run functions.sql in your (reporting) Evergreen database
    to create the collectionHQ schema and a couple functions.
[2] Edit extract.sh and extract_holds.sh to put in your library 
    code and FTP credentials with collectionHQ and email 
    parameters for the notification email that extract.sh can
    send.
[3] Run extract.sh and extract_holds.sh manually or set up a 
    periodic cronjob, for example:

0 2 20 * * cd /home/esi/collectionHQ && ./extract.sh
0 3 * * 0  cd /home/esi/collectionHQ && ./extract_holds.sh
